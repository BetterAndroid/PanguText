Typically, when mixing CJK (i.e. Chinese, Japanese, Korean) with English, aesthetic issues can arise—a historical legacy stemming from the differences in writing conventions between full-width and half-width characters. Although the W3C has now established CJK typography guidelines, only a few individuals or companies willing to adhere to these standards have adopted this approach.</p><p>Currently, the known vendor solutions are as follows:</p><ul><li>Apple platforms (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS) text typography solutions</li><li>Xiaomi’s (HyperOS) text typography optimization</li><li>OrginOS’s font-based text typography optimization</li></ul><p>However, these solutions are closed-source and cannot be implemented on other platforms. We aim to provide an open-source solution adaptable to various scenarios, featuring low intrusiveness and easy integration, allowing more developers to effectively address text typography issues.</p>',7),u={href:"https://github.com/vinta/pangu.js",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},m=n('<p>Heartfelt thanks to the original developer of <strong>pangu.js</strong> for providing the foundational solution.</p><h2 id="effects" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#effects" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Effects</h2><p>As you can see, the typography scheme of <code>PanguText</code> does not work by simply inserting spaces between CJK characters and English words. Instead, it leverages each platform&#39;s native handling to automatically add whitespace between these characters, ensuring minimal intrusion.</p><blockquote><p>Before Applying (Top) vs. After Applying (Bottom)</p></blockquote><img src="'+i+'" width="300"><blockquote><p>Dynamic Application</p></blockquote><img src="'+s+'" width="480"><p><code>PanguText</code> supports dynamic application, which means it can add whitespace gaps to each character on-the-fly as you input text.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Developer&#39;s Perspective</p><p>I personally do not recommend manually inserting spaces between CJK and English characters for typographic refinement if your software or system natively supports enhanced typographic formatting.</p><p>The spacing can vary across fonts, which may lead to formatting issues and the insertion of undesired space characters.</p><p>In certain contexts, such as URLs, filenames, or hashtags containing “#”, these spaces are not acceptable.</p><p>However, in special scenarios—for example, within code comments or documentation—it can be beneficial to add spaces, as these areas typically do not employ automated formatting tools.</p><p>Another point to consider is the use of different punctuation marks in different languages. Avoid mixing full-width and half-width punctuation marks. If you must use half-width punctuation marks to annotate full-width text, ensure that the half-width marks are followed by a space to complete the character space (the same applies to English).</p></div><h2 id="language-requirement" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#language-requirement" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Language Requirement</h2><p>It is recommended to use Kotlin as the preferred development language.</p><p>This project is entirely written in Kotlin and is compatible with Java in some parts, but it may not be fully compatible.</p><p>All demo &amp; sample codes in the document will be described using Kotlin, if you don’t know how to use Kotlin at all, you may not get the best experience.</p><h2 id="contribution" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#contribution" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Contribution</h2><p>The maintenance of this project is inseparable from the support and contributions of all developers.</p><p>This project is currently in its early stages, and there may still be some problems or lack of functions you need.</p>',16),f={href:"https://github.com/BetterAndroid/PanguText/issues",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"};function g(y,b){const a=c("ExternalLinkIcon");return p(),l("div",null,[d,t("p",null,[e("The primary inspiration for this project comes from "),t("a",u,[e("pangu.js"),o(a)]),e(", which offers a set of regular expressions for CJK typography.

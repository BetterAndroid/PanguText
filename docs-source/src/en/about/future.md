# Looking Toward the Future

> The future is bright and uncertain, let us look forward to the future development space of `PanguText`.

## Future Plans

> Features that `PanguText` may add later are included here.

### Limitations of SpannableString

`PanguText`'s main functionality on the Android platform currently comes from `SpannableString`, which has not yet fully resolved the issues of handling complex text styles and performance overhead.

### Jetpack Compose Plan

`PanguText` will support Jetpack Compose in the future and plans to use `AnnotatedString` as the main text processing method to minimize intrusion into the underlying layer.
